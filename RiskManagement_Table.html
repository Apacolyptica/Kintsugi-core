Risk brainstorming (not exactly IEEE format, but it's a prototype)

<table border="1">
<tr>
<td>Risk</td>				<td>Likelyhood</td>		<td>Impact (worst case)</td>		<td>Contingency</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Member leaves project:</td>		<td>Low</td>			<td>Severe</td>				<td>Other members take over lost member's work, ensure each member has a working competence of all duties.  Recalculate WBS and schedule accordingly.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Member Gets Sick (mild)</td>	<td>Medium</td>			<td>Low-Medium</td>			<td>If significant impact, readjust accordingly.  PM can provide emergency manpower for the sick person (it's preferred they recover and work competently rather than have extra errors under the weather)</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Member Gets Sick (severe)</td>	<td>Low-Medium</td>		<td>High</td>				<td>See "member leaves project."  Will re-re calculate things once member recovers enough to competently perform his/her duties.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Member gets injured (debilitating)</td><td>Low</td>			<td>Severe</td>				<td>Assuming the injury prevents competent performance of his/her duties, see the compensation for "member leaves project."</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Member has family emergency</td>	<td>Low</td>			<td>Medium-High</td>			<td>Assuming family emergency forbids work, other members will take over duties.  If a significant time is needed for the lost member, adjust WBS and schedule accordingly.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Member has to leave town (short time)</td><td>Medium</td>		<td>Medium</td>				<td>Try to find a means to work remotely.  Adjust WBS and schedule if this proves impossible.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Member has to leave town (long time)</td><td>Low</td>		<td>High</td>				<td>Try to find a means to do work remotely.  Recalculate according to new schedule.  See "member leaves project" if the situation cannot be salvaged.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Member's computer crashes</td>	<td>Medium</td>			<td>Medium-High</td>			<td>Keep files in Github for file sharing</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Project Falls Behind Schedule</td>	<td>Medium-High(sadly)</td>	<td>Medium-High</td>			<td>Recalculate WBS, PM will provide emergency manpower to whatever areas are highest priority.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Member's internet connection fails</td><td>Medium-High</td>		<td>Medium-High</td>			<td>Find a different means of connection, work off line if possible (alert other members via text or phone e-mail or social network).  If the problem persists, try to find a dedicated school workspace with a strong internet connection.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Members lack key knowledge</td>	<td>Very High</td>		<td>Medium-High</td>			<td>Adjust schedule estiamtes to assume research is required, place that into WBS to indicate a valid task and duty (if proof of progress is needed, a mini-report of "what I researched" can be written).</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Members non-project schedule is too heavy</td><td>Very High</td>	<td>High</td>				<td>See "project falls behind schedule."</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Customer is not available</td>	<td>High</td>			<td>Medium</td>				<td>Make judgments as the team sees fit, leave customer e-mail indicating judgments to the customer so they can confirm/deny them when time permits.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Report is behind schedule</td>	<td>Medium</td>			<td>High</td>				<td>If possible reallocate manpower to the report (however, the physical project still gets priority).  PM will write it if necessary.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Testing is behind schedule</td>	<td>Medium-High</td>		<td>Medium-High</td>			<td>Reallocate manpower for testing if possible.  If problem persists, reorganize testing plan.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Documentation is behind schedule</td><td>Medium-High</td>		<td>Medium-High</td>			<td>Reallocate manpower for documentation if possible.  Try to make "prototype documents" to work around for when work-light periods occur (to use as a base for catching up).</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Schedule estimation is significantly off</td><td>High</td>		<td>High</td>				<td>Readjust schedule estimation accordingly.  Possibly readjust expecations to core priorities.  Let customer know.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Project requirements are unclear</td><td>Very High</td>		<td>High</td>				<td>Ask customer CONCRETE questions to pierce any ambiguity "pierce the fluffy" as my contact at Aker called it).</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Project diverges from customers vision</td><td>Medium</td>		<td>High</td>				<td>Adjust project accordingly, salvage what we can (even unused 	parts can be good code samples to cannibalize from on present or future projects, so no deleting unless we have to).</td></tr>
</tr>
<td>Tasks are too complex</td>		<td>High</td>			<td>Medium</td>				<td>Further decompose WBS.  Divide accordingly.  Chances are, it	entails work we are already doing anyway on some level, so we just need to more clearly divide it.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Scope Creep</td>			<td>High</td>			<td>Severe</td>				<td>Negotiate very clear system boundaries, make sure core 	priorities are established.  Go out of the way to ask "what WON'T this application do in terms of the larger system."</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Miscommunication between customer and team</td><td>Very-High</td>	<td>High</td>				<td>Try to maintain clear communication (I know it's a "well duh" answer, but still).  Find a means to get concrete confirmation that we are talking about the same thing.</td></tr>

(here's the more opportunity kind of risk)
<table border="1"><tr>
<td>Opportunity</td>			<td>Likelyhood</td>		<td>Impact (best case)</td>		<td>Action taken</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Project is ahead of schedule</td>	<td>Medium</td>			<td>Medium</td>				<td>See if a bit more work can be worked in.  If schedule is negotiated with client, refactor code or try to get other classwork completed.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Overestimated task time</td>		<td>Medium</td>			<td>Medium</td>				<td>See "project is ahead of schedule."</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Report proceeding ahead of schedule</td><td>Medium</td>		<td>Medium-High</td>			<td>Reallocate work to the project if feasible.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Potential good idea for the project</td><td>Low</td>		<td>Medium</td>				<td>Ensure idea is within the scope of the system, add to the list of(outside the initial plan) requirements as a LOW PRIORITY (W) requirement (to minimize adverse affects on the schedule).</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>New technology provides unexpected assistance</td><td>Very low</td>	<td>High</td>				<td>Try to master such technology, add time to do so to the WBS. Possibly make a note in the report about it.</td></tr>
