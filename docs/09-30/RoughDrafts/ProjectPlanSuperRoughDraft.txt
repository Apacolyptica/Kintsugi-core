Project plan super ultra rough draft (again, subject to change A LOT).

Introduction:  The objectives of this project are to take the CWE database and place it in an application that can be more easily searched and understood by the end user then the current model, as well as to be able to allow the user to see the mapped relationships between CWEs.

Project Organization:  Doug Richardson will be doing the role of project manager (and thus, has to be the one who writes this...there goes his weekend).  Because of time and manpower constraints, he will volunteer himself as additional manpower to whichever tasks need extra attention.  Other team member assignments are TBA.

Risk Analysis:  See my risk analysis e-mail about that.

Hardware/Software requirements:  TBA.  At the very least, something that can parse XML somehow and map it out to a more usable database, as well as a compatible compiler for a CGI enabled language, as well as a usable web browser.

WBS: TBA

Project Schedule.

EXTREMELY VAGUE PROTOTYPE SCHEDULE

Initial documents (like this): 09/15/2013 at most (09/12/2013 preferred).

Requirements engineering, mockups, and extremely early prototyping: End of September

High priority requirements completion, more solid prototyping:  End of October

Completed* project and report: End of November

The report will be developed concurrently, but the product gets priority (the report will be largely cannibalized from documentation).

*No software project is ever truly "completed," but this is as far as we can go.

Monitoring Mechanism:  We chose github.
