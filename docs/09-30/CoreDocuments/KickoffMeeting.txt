Let the kickoff meeting begin

Questions
-Bounds of the system


1. Things we liked
	A. CWE-VIS category visiualization
		I.  Customers of old didn't care about category visualization
			a.  Categories get very low priority (visualization wise)

2. Searching mechanisms are all going to be full-text.
	A. How do we rank results (user defined?)
	B. Full text search capability is important.
	C. Presumably the XML schema is constant, so we can streamline uploader
	D. Updater schema may need to be done for XML style
	E. Possibly redirect from site to ye old CWE site.
	F. Possibly show relationship path if we're link diving (for backtracing).
	G. Text mining if we need to (get rid of things like "the" or "a", the sort of google bot style).

3. KEY FEATURES
	A. SEARCH
	B. NAVIGATION
	C. Filtration mechanism

4. Other features (not MUST-HAVE)
	A. Visualization (not max priority).
		I. Doesn't need to be blatant (it just needs to give tracepath context).
	B. Node-connectivity and other calcuations (communuty, connection).
	C. Shortest path Algorithm?
	D. We can focus on R/D Views above all else (if we have it all, we CAN still do it).
	E. Difference between version
	F. Admin Mode.
	G. Input validation

5. Ye olde similar projects
	A. Used .NET (didn't quite end well)

6. What we need
	A. Database (Loki?)
	B. Priorities (performance?)
	C. Prioritize well made core features above all else, a good "core" can spawn several secondary projects, and that's what counts.
