Work-Breakdown-Structure super early prototype.

Tasks I can see

1. Search engine
2. User interface (website)
3. Database

How tasks can be broken down.

Search engine will be an emergent property of the database and user interface

The user interface can be broken down in the following ways (from an initial investigation POV)
-HTML/CGI section (the web site part, probably can be broken down further the more we dig in to it).
-Middleware between website and database so the user can access it through said website
-CSS/Usability (aka "now that we got it, make it look pretty").
-Differences between end-user and admin mode (incase someone wants to make a change "manually").

The database can be broken down in the following ways.
-Understanding incoming XML data structures (that's gonna take some deciphering, so I count that as a task)
-Plotting the database schema (for the data and how we can relate it to other data, possibly through relational index views).
-Creating and setting up the database (the actual code part, we could just each create a local copy if it's too much trouble to set a committed one up).
-Creating an XML parser to populate the database
--Learning what parts go in what fields
--Figuring out how to automate relational data
-Being able to streamline and automate database population.

How I see this project, the data parsing and database population is going to come first, the website will be constructed around that.

Again, this is a super-ultra-prototype just to get something on the table, this is subject to change (and holy bleep will it).
